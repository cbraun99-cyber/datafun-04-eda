## Commands to Manage Virtual Environment

For Windows PowerShell (change if using Mac/Linux).
Verify that all required packages are included in requirements.txt (and have NOT been commented out).

```powershell
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
py -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
Commands to Run Python Scripts
Remember to activate your .venv (and install packages if they haven't been installed yet) before running files.

shell
py demo-script.py
Commands to Git add-commit-push
shell
git add .
git commit -m "custom message"
git push -u origin main
Iris Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Overview
This project includes an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the famous Iris dataset, performed within a Jupyter Notebook. The analysis leverages pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights within the data.

Author: Christopher Braun
Purpose: Exploratory Data Analysis of the Iris dataset using pandas and visualization tools.
Date: September 2025

Key Features
Data Loading & Inspection: Loads the dataset and examines its structure, shape, and data types.

Summary Statistics: Provides descriptive statistics to understand central tendency and dispersion.

Data Distribution: Visualizes distributions of numerical and categorical columns using histograms and count plots.

Data Transformation: Includes feature engineering to create new columns like sepal_area_cm2 and petal_area_cm2.

Advanced Visualizations: Generates pair plots, scatter plots, box plots, and a correlation heatmap to reveal relationships between variables and across species.

How to Run the Analysis
Ensure Jupyter is installed. If not, install it using:

powershell
py -m pip install jupyter
Launch Jupyter Notebook from your project directory:

powershell
jupyter notebook
Open the iris_eda.ipynb file from the Jupyter dashboard.

Run all cells sequentially to execute the analysis and generate the visualizations.

Dependencies
The analysis requires the following Python packages, which are included in the requirements.txt file:

pandas

seaborn

matplotlib

numpy

jupyter

To install them, run:

powershell
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
Key Insights
The analysis revealed:

Species Distinction: The three iris species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) are clearly distinguishable based on their measurements, particularly petal dimensions.

Measurement Patterns: Setosa has the smallest petals but the widest sepals, while Virginica has the largest petals on average.

Strong Correlations: Petal length and width are highly correlated (0.96).

Feature Utility: Engineered features (e.g., sepal area, petal area) provide additional dimensions that could be useful for classification tasks.

Data Quality: The dataset is complete with no missing values and is perfectly balanced across the three species.
